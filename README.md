# Thank you!

Thank you to the HiHello team for this second chance. I've built a new calculator from scratch with a number of improvements.

I'm looking forward to your feedback.

## Improvements

- Utilized a reducer, which is a much more scalable solution than the previous version.
- Simplified the ActionType.OPERATOR code for increased readability.
- Improved Button component to be more reusable.
- Additional minor improvements also made

## How to run

npm i && npm run dev
